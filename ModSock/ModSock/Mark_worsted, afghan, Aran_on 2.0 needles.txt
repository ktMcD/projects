TURNING THE HEEL 
For the next few rows, we will only be working on the sole needle (Needle 1), leaving Needle 2 unworked for now. 
You should have placed markers inside the new gusset stitches on the two ends of Needle 1, leaving the original sole stitches in the center.
Row 1 (right side - RS): Knit to 1 stitch before second marker, Wrap & Turn (W&T);
Row 2: (wrong side - WS): Purl to 1 stitch before the first marker, W&T;
Row 3: Knit to 2 stitches before the last wrap, W&T 
Row 4: Purl to 2 stitches before the last wrap, W&T 
Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you have 24 stitches remaining betweent the wraps closes to the center, ending with a PURL row
Next two rows:
    Row 1: Knit across the sole stitches, working each wrap together with the stitch it wraps, W&T.
    Row 2: Purl across the sole stitches, purling the stitches you just knit together and working each wrap together with the stitch it wraps, W&T. 
You have just completed turning the heel!!
