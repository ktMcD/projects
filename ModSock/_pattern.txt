How to work wrapped stitches:
    Knit Row:
        Pick up front bar of wrap as if to knit and place it on left needle
        Slip wrap and wrapped stitch to right needle as if to knit
        Insert left needle into front of two slipped stitches on right needle (as in an SSK)
        Knit the two stitches together
    Purl Row:
        Pick up back bar of wrap and place iton left needle with the stitch it wrapped 
        Purl both stitches together

==============================================


Backward Yarn Over (BYO)

Toe: 
Cast on 32 stitches using Judy's magic cast-on (that's 16 stitches per needle) 
Row 1: Knit around; 
Row 2 both needles: Knit 1, backwards yarn over (BYO), knit to last stitch, yarn over (YO), knit last stitch. 
                    You have increased the number of stitches on each needle by 2 
Row 3 both needles: Knit 1, knit into the BYO you made in the previous row (it should knit twisted) 
                    Knit to second-to-last stitch (the last YO you made in the previous row), 
                         knit into back of the YO (it should knit twisted), knit last stitch 
Repeat rows 2 and 3 until you have increased to 96 stitches 
    You should have added 64 stitches (32 stitches each end).
over 16 rows. End on a row-3 row. 

Knit straight for 3.783333333333333 inches (approx. 48 rows)

GUSSET:
Now it's time to increase for the gusset of our sock. 
Over the next 3.5666666666666673 inches (approximately 44 rows), you will increase only on the sole needle (needle 1).
Row 1 Needle 1: knit 1, PLACE MARKER, BYO, knit to second-to-last stitch, YO, PLACE MARKER, knit last stitch;
Row 1 Needle 2: knit across; 
Row 2 Needle 1: knit 1, knit into BYO you made in the previous row, 
                knit across to second-to-last stitch (the YO you made in the previous row), knit into the back of the YO (it should knit twisted);
Row 2 Needle 2: knit across; 
Repeat rows 1 and 2 until you have added 44 stitches to Needle 1, for a total of 92 stitches on Needle 1.

TURNING THE HEEL 
For the next few rows, we will only be working on the sole needle (Needle 1), leaving the instep needle (Needle 2) unworked for now. 
You should have placed markers inside the new gusset stitches on the two ends of Needle 1, leaving the original sole stitches in the center.
Row 1 (right side - RS): Knit to 1 stitch before second marker, Wrap & Turn (W&T);
Row 2: (wrong side - WS): Purl to 1 stitch before the first marker, W&T;
Row 3: Knit to 2 stitches before the last wrap, W&T 
Row 4: Purl to 2 stitches before the last wrap, W&T 
Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you have approximately 32 stitches left between the wraps closest to the center, 
  end with PURL row
Next two rows:
    Row 1: Knit across the sole stitches, working each wrap together with the stitch it wraps, W&T.
    Row 2: Purl across the sole stitches, purling the stitches you just knit together and working each wrap together with the stitch it wraps, W&T. 
You have just completed turning the heel!!
