        slip next stitch purlwise onto right needle 
        bring yarn to front 
        put the slipped stitch back onto left needle 
        turn 
        bring yarn to front (because your new row will be a purl row) 
        Place Marker 

    Purlwise: 
        slip next stitch purlwise onto right needle 
        bring yarn to back 
        put the slipped stitch back ontoleft needle 
        turn

============================================= 


How to work wrapped stitches:
    Knit Row:
        Pick up front bar of wrap as if to knit and place it on left needle
        Slip wrap and wrapped stitch to right needle as if to knit
        Insert left needle into front of two slipped stitches on right needle (as in an SSK)
        Knit the two stitches together
    Purl Row:
        Pick up back bar of wrap and place iton left needle with the stitch it wrapped 
        Purl both stitches together

==============================================


Backward Yarn Over (BYO) 
    Bring the yarn over your right needle from BACK to FRONT 
    knitting into the front of this stitch on the next row will create an invisible increase
Yarn Over (YO) 
    Bring the yarn over your right needle FRONT to BACK 
    knitting into the back of this stitch on next row will create an invisible increase

==============================================


Toe: 
Cast on 16 stitches using Judy's magic cast-on or the Turkish cast-on 
    (that's 8 stitches per needle) 
Row 1: Knit around; 
Row 2 both needles: Knit 1, yarn over (YO), knit to last stitch, backwards yarn over (BYO), knit last stitch. 
                    You have increased the number of stitches on each needle by 2 
Row 3 both needles: Knit 1, knit into the back of the YO you made in the previous row (it should knit twisted) 
                    Knit to second-to-last stitch (the last BYO you made in the previous row), 
                         knit into the BYO (it should knit twisted), knit last stitch 
Repeat rows 2 and 3 until you have increased to 46 stitches 
    You should have added 30 stitches (15 stitches each end).
over 15 rows. End on a row-3 row. 

Knit straight until your sock measures 0.0 inches from the toe 
    (approx. 15 rows from the toe ) (about 2/3 of your total sock length)

GUSSET:
Now it's time to increase for the gusset of our sock. 
Over the next 23 rows), you will increase only on the sole needle (needle 1 ("N1")).
Row 1 N1: knit 1, YO, knit to second-to-last stitch, BYO, knit last stitch;
Row 1 Needle 2 ("N2"): knit across; 
Row 2 N1: knit 1, knit into back of the YO you made in the previous row, 
          knit across to second-to-last stitch (the YO you made in the previous row), 
          knit into the the YO (it should knit twisted);
Row 2 N2: knit across; 
Row 3 N1: knit 1, PLACE MARKER, YO, knit to second-to-last stitch, PLACE MARKER, BYO, knit last stitch;
Row 3 N2: knit across; 
Row 4 N1: follow instructions for Row 1 N1;
Row 4 N2: knit across; 
Repeat rows 1 and 2 until you have added 21 stitches to N1, for a total of 44 stitches on N1.

TURNING THE HEEL 
For the next few rows, we will only be working back and forth on the sole needle (N1), leaving the instep needle (N2) unworked for now. 
You should have placed markers inside the new gusset stitches on the two ends of Needle 1, leaving the original sole stitches in the center.
Row 1 (right side - RS): Knit to 1 stitch before second marker, Wrap & Turn (W&T);
Row 2: (wrong side - WS): Purl to 1 stitch before the first marker, W&T;
Row 3: Knit to 2 stitches before the last wrap, W&T 
Row 4: Purl to 2 stitches before the last wrap, W&T 
Repeat rows 3 and 4 until you have 8 stitches remaining between the wraps closest to the center, ending with a PURL row
Next two rows:
    Row 1: Knit across the sole stitches, working each wrap together with the stitch it wraps, W&T.
    Row 2: Purl across the sole stitches, purling the stitches you just knit together and working each wrap together with the stitch it wraps, W&T. 
Congratulations! You have just completed turning the heel!!

HEEL FLAP
Row 1 (RS): Knit to second marker, slip wrap, slip wrapped stitch, slip next stitch (total of 3), knit all 3 together, turn 
Row 2 (WS): Slip 1, purl to first marker, slip wrap, slip wrapped stitch, slip next stitch (total of 3), purl all 3 together, turn 
Row 3 (RS): Slip 1, knit 1, slip 1, knit 1, repeating all the way across to 1 stitch before marker, ssk, turn (slip as if to knit)
Row 4 (WS): Slip 1, purl to 1 stitch before marker, purl next two together, turn 
Repeat rows 3 and 4 until all RS side stitches have been worked, end on a knit row.
Here you will note that we haven't consumed the last two stitches on the WS (one stitch before the gap and one stitch after.
Don't worry about these.
We are stopping one row short so that we avoid that pesky gap at the intersection of the gusset and the foot tube. 
Now we'll return to working in the round, knitting across Needle 2 ("N2") to finish the round. 
When you get back around to the beggining of the sole stitches, you should see a stitch and a gap before the next stitck. K2Tog those two stitches to close the gap.
Knit across the rest of the round.

Return to working in the round, knitting straight until you have knitted as much leg as you want. 

Switch to one size smaller needles for cuff. Knit the cuff in K1P1 ribbing. Bind off when you like the length of your cuff. 
I really like the bind-off that Staci Perry teaches us on YouTube at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SbzeEg6XMwM&feature=youtu.be
